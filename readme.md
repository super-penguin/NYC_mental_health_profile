##### Exploration

Please see the detail in "NYC_mental_health_profile_new.html".

The goals of my project here are:

1. To gain insights of the mental health situation in NYC;

2. To discover potentially effective interventions and provide guidance for the distribution of fundings and services of NYC to finally improve new yorkersâ€™ mental health.

The data I am using is from Health Data NY, Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS)[3]. The raw data includes the NY hospitalization inpatient discharges for all diseases from 2009-2014.

This file has 3 sections.

    - Section 1: Explore the 2014 dataset and discovery interesting patterns.

    - Section 2: Explore the combined dataset from 2009-2014; Analyze the econimic burdens caused by mental diseases in NYC.

    - Section 3: Three Final plots.
